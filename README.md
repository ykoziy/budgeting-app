# Budgeting App

Budgeting App (with ugly color palette) allows you to store all of you expenses and income. Currently only expenses are shown on the graph. Still WIP. Project built just to practice using plain JS without any frameworks to build the web application. Just to appreciate how frameworks make the process of building web applications much simpler.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- Webpack
- D3.js
- Jest
- Sass

## Features

- Almost MVC
- Add/remove expenses and incomes with confirmation modal
- Edit income/expense
- Remove/edit category
- Categorize expenses
- Show $ amount per category and item, also the total is shown

## Challenges

- Separation of concern in JS can be tough especially between view and model.

## TO DO

- Add some sort of storage (LocalStorage might be enough for this project)
- Add better design (that ugly color palette)
- Think about making the graph more interactive?
